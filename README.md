# Codepath Honeypot (Project 9)
Honeypot Project for Codepath


# Type of Honeypot
Dionaea over HTTP: a low interaction, server side honeypot that tries to trap malware samples.


# Issues encountered
In general, there weren't any issues for creating this honeypot. I would say that the only thing to slow me down was waiting for attackers/IP Scanners to actually try to access my honeypot.
